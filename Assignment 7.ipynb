    "3. `Provide Public Interfaces`: Define public methods (also known as accessors or getters) that allow external code to interact with the object and access or modify its data. These methods provide a controlled interface to the internal data, ensuring that data is accessed or modified in a consistent and controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Access Data Through Methods`: Encourage the use of these public methods to access or modify the data rather than directly accessing the private attributes. This allows the class to enforce any necessary validation, perform additional operations, or maintain data consistency before exposing it to the outside world."
