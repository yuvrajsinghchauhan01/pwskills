It happens when something unexpected or abnormal happens, such as dividing a number by zero, trying to access a file that doesn't exist, or encountering a network error. When an exception occurs, the program stops running unless we handle the exception using special code.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Syntax Error`: A syntax error, on the other hand, happens when the code itself is not written correctly according to the rules of the programming language. It occurs when there are mistakes in the way the code is structured or written, like missing parentheses, using incorrect indentation, or misspelling a keyword. These errors prevent the program from running at all because the code doesn't make sense to the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, exceptions happen when something unexpected occurs during program execution, while syntax errors occur when the code itself is not written correctly. Exceptions can be handled using special code, while syntax errors need to be fixed before the program can run properly."
